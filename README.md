# drupal-hero-theme

A simple theme for drupal based on comic book heroes.

## Installation

There are two main folders in this project: the container 'drupal-hero-theme'
(separated with dashes), with README.txt and the project's license, and the
actual theme 'drupal_hero_theme' (separated with underscores). Copy the last one
into your `drupal/themes` folder. Then go to `appearance` and you will see the
'drupal_hero_theme' uninstalled. Install it and you're good to go.

## Placing blocks

If your layout doesn't look great at first that's because you need to place
the blocks in their appropriate region. There are five main regions in this
theme. `navbar` for navigation links, `header` with the main image and the page
title, `aside` with side content, `content` for main page content and finally
`footer` for secondary links and information. This is the recommended layout
structure, but you're free to create your own.
